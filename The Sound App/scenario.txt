Scenario Use Case: Guess the Instrument Game

1. The user opens the 'Guess the Instrument' app.
2. The main window of the app displays the title 'AudioPlayer'.
3. The user is presented with an instruction label that reads "Listen to the sound and guess the instrument:".
4. Automatically, the first sound starts playing. It's sourced from the 'assets' folder, corresponding to the first instrument in the list, for example, 'guitar.mp3'.

5. While the sound is playing, the user looks at the dropdown selection box, which lists the instrument options: Guitar, Violin, Piano, Cello, Trumpet, and Drums.
6. The user selects an instrument from the dropdown that they believe matches the sound being played.
7. The user then clicks on the 'Submit Guess' button to submit their guess.

8. Upon clicking 'Submit Guess':
   a. The sound stops playing immediately to prevent overlapping if another sound is triggered.
   b. A 10-second timer that was started with the sound is canceled to avoid auto progression.
   c. The app checks if the user's guess matches the correct instrument for the played sound.
   d. The result of the guess is then displayed in a label below the button. 
      - If correct, it reads "Correct! It was a Guitar." (assuming guitar was the correct answer)
      - If incorrect, it reads "Incorrect! It was a Guitar." (with the correct instrument name)
   
9. The app then automatically moves to the next sound in the list and starts playing it.
   - Another 10-second timer starts for the user to make their guess.

10. Steps 5-9 repeat until all sounds have been played.

11. After the last sound:
    a. The 'Submit Guess' button no longer starts new sounds.
    b. The final results are displayed to the user, showing the number of correct guesses out of the total, e.g., "Game Over! You guessed 2 out of 3 correctly."
    c. The user can close the app by clicking the window's close button or via the File menu.

Throughout the interaction, the Toga widgets handle events as follows:
- The Selection widget captures the user's choice and holds it until the 'Submit Guess' button is pressed.
- The Button widget triggers event handlers when clicked to submit guesses, play sounds, and manage the game's state.
- Labels are used to give real-time feedback to the user, displaying instructions, results, and the final message.
